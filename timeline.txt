>2000 mya: Initial Supecontinent forms.
2000 mya: Supercontinent splits forming continents ABC and DEFGH.
1950 mya: New ocean crust and island arcs take form. Failed rifts prolong.
1900 mya: Continents continue to drift appart, creating more ocean. Failed rifts prolong.
1850 mya: Continents continue to drift appart, creating even more ocean.
1800 mya: Continents ABC and DEFGH split forming continents A and BC, and F and DEGH respectively. Two new oceanic plates appear as a result of two triple junctions.
1750 mya: The four continents continue to drift appart.
1700 mya: A fragment of contienent A splits into microcontinent 1, while continent DEGH splits into continents DE and GH. New ocean is created, and a part of an oceanic plate is subducted. Two other new oceanic crust form due to the continental breakup.
1650: Continents A and GH collide and multiple ocean slabs subduct. Continent C splits from B.
1600: Continents DE, AGH and microcontinent 1 collide forming continent DEAGH1. Continents B and F collide into new continent BF.
